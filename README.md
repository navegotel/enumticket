# enumticket #

With this package generating numbered or labeled tickets and imposing 
them on paper hardly takes ten lines of code. 

The tickets are highly customizable, elements such as 
counters, background images, etc. Crop marks with or without bleeds
can be added.

There are different layouts available which make cutting the sheets
into stacks of ordered tickets pretty easy. However, tickets can also
be laid out sequentially or at random order.

The code is verbosely commented (look at ticket.py first) and there
is a commented sample script.
